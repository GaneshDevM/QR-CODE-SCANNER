# QR Code Scanner

This project is a simple QR Code Scanner built using React. It utilizes the `jsQR` library to read QR codes from the user's camera input and display the decoded information.

## Features

- **Real-time QR Code Scanning:** Scans QR codes using the device's camera.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works on most modern browsers.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GaneshDevM/QR-CODE-SCANNER.git
   cd QR-CODE-SCANNER
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the project, use the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized production build in the `build` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your preferred hosting service.

## Usage

1. **Access the App:**

   Open the app in your browser (http://localhost:3000/ by default).

2. **Grant Camera Access:**

   The app will prompt you to grant access to your device's camera.

3. **Scan QR Code:**

   Hold a QR code in front of your camera. The app will automatically detect and decode the QR code.

4. **View the Results:**

   The decoded information from the QR code will be displayed on the screen.
